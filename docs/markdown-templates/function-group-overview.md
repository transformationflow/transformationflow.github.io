# txflow Function Group Overview

## Summary
Transformation Flow (`txflow`) functions are organised into logical groups depending on the type of activity they support.  

These groups are either aligned to the sequential stages in a typical data pipeline (`ingest` → `profile` → `transform` → `export` → `monitor`) or groups which support data administration (`admin`) or the development of new functionality and flows (`work_in_progress`, `transformations`)
