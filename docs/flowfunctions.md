# Function Reference
We believe that the best place for documentation to live is within your existing workflow, avoiding task switching and potential distractions.  As such the latest version of the documentation can always be found by executing the following command in your query editor:

```sql
SELECT flowfunctions.help.all()
```

Additional help commands will be detailed in the query results window upon running this help command.
