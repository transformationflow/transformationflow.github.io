# The Zen of SQL
## Introduction
Inspired by the Python equivalent ([PEP20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) - The Zen of Python), and also using it as a starting point, the TFSQL10[^1] are the core guiding principles which are central to writing clean, clear, well-structured and easy to maintain data transformations in SQL, and which are the guiding principles for all SQL code written by our functions and/or humans.

## TFSQL10
> - Readability counts.
> - Explicit is better than implicit.
> - Simple is better than complex.
> - Complex is better than complicated.
> - Flat is better than nested.
> - Errors should never pass silently.
> - Unless explicitly silenced.
> - Predictable is better than flexible.
> - Modular is better than monolithic.
> - Common Table Expressions are a seriously great idea - let's do more of those!

[^1]: Whilst the Python PEP20 actually only contains 19 aphorisms, the Transformation Flow SQL 10 (TFSQL10) contains exactly 10.
