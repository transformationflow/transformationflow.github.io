## Who we are
![Google Cloud Partners](assets/logos/google-cloud-partner-logo-horizontal-outline-400.png)

Transformationflow OÃœ is a [Google Cloud Partner](https://cloud.google.com/find-a-partner/partner/transformationflow-%C3%96u), headquartered in Estonia (EU). 

We are a remote, specialist team of Google Cloud Certified [Professional Data Engineers](https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/data-engineer) who build data automation solutions, capabilities and products on Google Cloud.  We have been working exclusively with Google Cloud and BigQuery since 2017.

## What we do
We design, build, manage and license serverless Google Cloud data automation solutions, capabilities and products.


## How we do it
We use [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) as a foundation, in addition to complementary Google Cloud products such as:

- [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) for file ingestion, storage and backup
- [Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub) for streaming data, messaging and scheduled query monitoring
- [Python Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions) for custom actions, notifications and interaction with external APIs
- [Remote Functions](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/remote-functions) to deploy Cloud Functions in BigQuery workflows
- [Scheduled Queries](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/scheduling-queries) for automation and orchestration
- [BigQuery ML](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bqml-introduction) for AI/ML and generative AI workflows
- [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/) for end-user and data monitoring dashboards

We have advanced capabilities in all aspects of [GoogleSQL](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax) and the GoogleSQL [procedural language](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/procedural-language).  We use these capabilities to build functions, procedures and table functions which solve complex data automation challenges in a rapid, scalable and replicable manner.
