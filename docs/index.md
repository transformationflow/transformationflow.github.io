## What's the problem?
'Data Integration' is commonly defined as the process of getting data into a single location, which in a modern data stack means a cloud data warehouse.  So what does 'integration' actually mean?

!!! definition
    **integration** [Uncountable or singular noun] /ˌɪn.tɪˈɡreɪ.ʃən/
    
    the action or process of combining two or more things in an effective way 
    
    [Cambridge English Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/integration)

So by developing mechanisms (commonly referred to as data pipelines) to co-locate data on a single platform, is this really data 'integration'. Well, not really.

True data integration actually involves integrating the data (well, duh), which is a different type of complexity to the challenge of getting data into a data warehouse in a timely and reliable manner.
