## Overview
### What is Transformation Flow?
Transformation Flow is a lightweight, opinionated framework for planning, implementing, managing and monitoring in-warehouse data transformations.

### What is a data transformation
A data transformation is a sequence of one or more SQL statements which take data as an input and results in data as an output.

### What problem does it solve?


### Why SQL?
SQL is the common language for anybody who works with data. It is an extremely powerful if imperfect language, and its capability and widespread adoption makes it the default choice for any data transformation application.

### SQL shortcomings
However SQL is not perfect. It can be extremely verbose, which makes it difficult to write code without manually copy-pasting sections and requiring manual human update of references. This unwelcome introduction of human interference is a potential source of errors, which can then be difficult to detect in the resulting code.
